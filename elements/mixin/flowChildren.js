     * Steps:
     *   1 - if last child is already flowing, then reflow it
     *   1a- if after that we are still overflowing AND the last child is
     *       still flowing, then something went wrong (the child should
     *       have flowed all the way in to this.flowInto and normalize)
     *   1b- if we are no longer overflowing and the child is still
     *       flowing then we are done overflowing
     *   1c- if last child flowed completed to this.flowInto then go to step 2
     *
     *   2 - while we have flowInto
     *   2a- flow children to/from flowInto
     *   2b- if flowInto is now empty, remove it from flow
     *   2c- repeat 2
     *
     *      (now we should no longer be overflowing)
     *
     *   3 - if first child in "flowInto" supports flow, then:
     *   3a- pull child back to "this"
     *   3b- call child.flow()
     *
     *   4 - normalize flow in case all children moved out/in
     *
     * @param {Function} overflowingFunc to indicate if we are overflowing
